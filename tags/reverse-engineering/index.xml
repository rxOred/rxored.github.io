Often, hackers utilize microsoft office suite to gain initial access (using droppers, loaders) to the victim and Windows powershell to explore internal network, perform scans&amp;hellip; basically to do the post exploitation stuff.</description>

      <description>Oh hi. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of competitive programming. Anyhow, I wanted to test my DSA skills so i started doing leetcode a week(or two ig)ago. And I spent an entire day solving some of those challenges. Eventually I came cross a medium level challege, named Reorder List. problem is pretty simple, you are given a head node of a linked list, what you have to do is kinda shuffle nodes around.</description>

      <description>So last time we finished some exercises from the book pratical reverse engineering. Now, we have page 35 exercises. I wont cover exercise here because some are really straight forward.
without useless intros lets get started.
Chaper 1, page 35 We are starting with the second one, because first one is pretty easy. 2nd question asks us to decompile DllMain.
as we can see, IDA has generated us some information of the stack as well as a nice graph view.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello, rxOred here, with another badly written write-up.
A years ago, i started reading practical reverse engineering book. Eventhough I was familiar with most of those concepts, that book&amp;rsquo;s exercises were pretty challenging. Aand guess what, there were no solutions to those Exercises in the book. Authors have encouraged RE community to share solutions with others using their blogs, r/reverse-egnineering etc.
At that time, i never really wanted to create a blog.</description>

      <description>Compilers This article is all about compilers.
For many people, a compiler is a mystery. for them, it is like a magical black box that takes the source file as an input and generates a binary file that can be executed.
However, the truth to be told, compilers are not wizards. In this article, we will start from the introduction to the front-end of a compiler from a reverse-engineering perspective.</description>
