```ruby
    int init_module(void)
    {
        pr_info("Welcome to this ugly looking static web    \ 
        site Github generated for Me!\n");
        return 0;
    }
``` 

As my web designing and development skills are far too superior for humans to understand (lies liessss), i decided to use this thing as `my portfolio` thing :)

I'm looking forward to start a blog where i can put all my useless research articles and projects :^)

### Hold up, whoami?

Well Im just a 17y/o student from Sri Lanka (sadly). I taught myself many things related to computer science when i was a kid (legally, i still am). And I like to do things that require deep understanding of how computers work :). Specifically, kernel/system programming, reverse engineering and malware analysis. Interested in BIOS/UEFI security, but dont have much knowledge in that area. 

Big fan of rock (electronic, emo, grunge), old school east coast hiphop, new wave music and dark horse comics. Hate animals but i used to draw them as a kid. I lack the creative side of my brain (metaphysical retardation). so i dont draw anymore. Usually I read technical books but rarely, i go for chinese philosophy(translations of course) stuff. 

As for now, my formal education is -insert bad word here- up.

### Stuff I know

- C/C++/C hashtag :^) - C++ is my language of choice and the first i have learned (well technically i wrote hello world in java but eh). i learned C++ for arduino and i used C++ heavily when i was into unreal engine and game programming(suprise suprise!). when i started using linux as my main dev environment, i did spend a considerable amount of time with C. And i love its simplicity. 
- x86 assembly - Then i learned a little bit assembly just to debug my lame -insert bad word here- programs, eventually i got into reverse engineering. so I learned more about intel assembly by Reading TFM.
- python - yeah i had to learn python to revise some programming concepts cus i spent an entire year on a pathetic game:3. did some bat<insert bad word here> crazy stuff with python. it was fun.
- golang - wanted to learn a new lang, so i started with go this year, replaced my python stuff with go (because its fast and beautiful). im planning to use golang for SiliconCemetery's backend since i dont really like nodejs. 
- .Net framework - thanks for my windows C++ experience, i know a bit about .net.
- Javascript - i dont like javascript.
- Nim (not much tbh) - still learning. boring syntax. but fine.

### Stuff I do

- kernel programming - linux to be more specific.
- systems programming
- reverse engineering
- malware analysis - rootkits and botnets, aah i love em.
- CTFs :^) - i dont have a team and not a pro. 
- IoT (ESP and arduino) - WIFI security stuff. not very useful.
- and sometimes I draw things

### Stuff I use

- vim / lunarvim / emacs
- vs / vscode
- GNU/Linux ..yeah sometimes windows, for reverse engineering purposes of course.
- radare2 on linux
- x64dbg on windows
- used IDA but not anymore.

### My cool projects :^)

**Finished** - 
- **[zkz](https://github.com/rxOred/zkz.git)** `x86 linux debugger written in C++. more features incoming!!!`
- **[elfparse](https://github.com/rxOred/elfparse.git)** `Elf parser written in C.`
- **[spidyBOT](https://github.com/rxOred/spidyBOT.git)** `A web spider and information gathering tool written in python.` capable of extracting emails from parsed docs.
- **[BURUWA](https://github.com/rxOred/BURUWA.git)** `Very minimal Linux shell. pretty much useless :^).` might implement pipes, autocompletion and stuff later.
- **[InjElf](https://github.com/rxOred/InjElf.git)** `Elf malware written in C (PoC).` not necessarilly a malware, its more of an infector (i cant just upload malware on my github)
    
**Not yet finished** -
- **[rurik](https://github.com/rxOred/rurik.git)** `TUI text editor with some other IDE like features.` i wanted to make something like spacevim. ill probably rewrite the whole codebase in golang:3
- **[InjPE](https://github.com/rxOred/InjPE.git)** `PE malware written in C++(PoC).`
- **[WormLikeSnake]** `Another self replicating Elf malware written in C`
- **[Lib]** `cpu information parsing thing ig`

### Currently working on

- trying to build sri lanka's first known hackerspace - SiliconCemetery
- building a web application for SiliconCemetery with few other people (status - UI design is done)
- working on an efficient terminal user interface for zkz debugger and implementing cde injection and elf reconstruction
- trying to make this site look better, more interactive and more informative

### Support or Contact

So you wanna support me? criticize my code, tell me how bad it is, send me reviews. That helps me to be a better programmer and thats all i want :^)
