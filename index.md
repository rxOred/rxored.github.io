```ruby
    int init_module(void)
    {
        pr_info("Welcome to this ugly looking static web    \ 
        site Github generated for Me!\n");
        return 0;
    }
```

As my web designing and development skills are far too superior for humans to understand (lies lies), I decided to use this thing as `my portfolio` thing :)

Soon, I'll start a blog where I can put all my useless research articles and projects :^)

### Hold up, whoami?

Well, I'm just a 17y/o student from Sri Lanka (sadly). I taught myself many things related to computer science. And I like to do things that require a deep understanding of how computers work :). Specifically, kernel/system programming, reverse engineering, and malware analysis. Interested in BIOS/UEFI security, but don't have much knowledge in that area. 

Big fan of rock (electronic, emo, grunge), old-school east coast hip-hop, new wave music, and dark horse comics. 

As for now, my formal education is <insert bad word here> up.

### Stuff I know

- C/C++/C hashtag :^) - C++ is my language of choice and the first I have learned (well technically I wrote hello world in java but eh). I learned C++ for Arduino and I used C++ heavily when I was into unreal engine and game programming(surprise surprise!). when I started using Linux as my main dev environment, I did spend a considerable amount of time with C. And I love its simplicity. 
- x86 assembly - Then I learned a little bit assembly just to debug my lame <insert bad word here> programs, eventually I got into reverse engineering. so I learned more about intel assembly by Reading TFM.
- python - yeah I had to learn python to revise some programming concepts cus I spent an entire year on a pathetic game:3. did some bat<insert bad word here> crazy stuff with python. it was fun.
- golang - wanted to learn a new lang, so I started with go this year, replaced my python stuff with go (because it's fast and beautiful). The backend of  SiliconCemetery web app will be implemented in golang since I don't like nodejs. 
- .Net framework - thanks for my windows C++ experience, I know a bit about .net.
- Javascript - I don't like javascript.
- Nim (not much tbh) - still learning. boring syntax. but fine.

### Stuff I do

- kernel programming - Linux to be more specific.
- systems programming
- reverse engineering
- malware analysis - rootkits and botnets, aah I love em.
- CTFs :^) - I don't have a team and am not a pro. 
- IoT (ESP and Arduino) - WIFI security stuff. not very useful.
- and sometimes I draw things

### Stuff I use

- vim / lunarvim / emacs
- vs / vscode
- GNU/Linux ..yeah sometimes windows, for reverse engineering purposes of course.
- radare2 on Linux
- x64dbg on windows
- used IDA but not anymore.

### My cool projects :^)

**Finished** - 
- **[zkz](https://github.com/rxOred/zkz.git)** `x86 linux debugger written in C++. more features incoming!!!`
- **[elfparse](https://github.com/rxOred/elfparse.git)** `Elf parser written in C.`
- **[spidyBOT](https://github.com/rxOred/spidyBOT.git)** `A web spider and information gathering tool written in python.` capable of extracting emails from parsed docs.
- **[BURUWA](https://github.com/rxOred/BURUWA.git)** `Very minimal Linux shell. pretty much useless :^).` might implement pipes, autocompletion, and stuff later.
- **[InjElf](https://github.com/rxOred/InjElf.git)** `Elf malware written in C (PoC).` not necessarily a malware, it's more of an infector (i cant just upload malware on my Github)
**Not yet finished** -
- **[rurik](https://github.com/rxOred/rurik.git)** `TUI text editor with some other IDE-like features.` i wanted to make something like spacevim. ill probably rewrite the whole codebase in golang:3
- **[InjPE](https://github.com/rxOred/InjPE.git)** `PE malware written in C++(PoC).`
- **[WormLikeSnake]** `Another self-replicating Elf malware written in C`
- **[Lib]** `cpu information parsing thing ig`

### Currently working on

- trying to build Sri Lanka's first known hackerspace - SiliconCemetery
- building a web application for SiliconCemetery with few other people (status - UI design is done)
- working on an efficient terminal user interface for zkz debugger and implementing code injection and elf reconstruction
- trying to make this site look better, more interactive, and more informative

### Support or Contact

So you wanna support me? criticize my code, tell me how bad it is, send me reviews. That helps me to be a better programmer and that's all I want :^)
