```ruby
    int init_module(void)

        site Github generated for Me!\n");

``` 


First of all, this web site is temporary, I'm looking forward to start a blog where i can put all my research articles and projects :^)

### Hold up, whoami?

Well, name is Jayod, a 17 years old student from Sri lanka. I taugh myself many things related to computer science when I was a kid. I prefer to do things that require deep understanding of how computers work, kernel/system programming, reverse engineering and malware analysis to be more precise. Im also interested in BIOS/UEFI security and APTs(advance persistant threads).
 
Usually I read technical books but rarely, i choose chinese philosophy(translations of course), thriller mystery type books. 

about my education, I follow a Higher national diploma in computing while doing GCE/A/Ls in technology + higher mathematics. 

### Im familiar with,

- C / C++/ C# - C++ is my language of choice and the first language i have learned (though i wrote my first hello world in Java). I learned C++ for arduino and i freqently used C++ when i was into unreal engine and game programming. When i changed my OS to linux, i spent a considerable amount of time with C doing low level development.
- x86/x64 assembly - I have a good understanding of intel x86 and x64 instruction set architectures. I learned asm to debug my programs, eventally i started reverse engineering and now, assembly is natural to me.
- python - I learned python a year ago, just to save time by automating stuff.
- golang - Learned few months ago, i love it and replaced python with golang :3
- Javascript - I know the basics of javascript and how the web works in general :3
- Nim (not much tbh)


- C/C++/C hashtag :^) - C++ is my language of choice and the first i have learned (well technically i wrote hello world in java but eh). i learned C++ for arduino and i used C++ heavily when i was into unreal engine and game programming(suprise suprise!). when i started using linux as my main dev environment, i did spend a considerable amount of time with C. And i love its simplicity. 
- x86 assembly - Then i learned a little bit assembly just to debug my lame -insert bad word here- programs, eventually i got into reverse engineering. so I learned more about intel assembly by Reading TFM.
- python - yeah i had to learn python to revise some programming concepts cus i spent an entire year on a pathetic game:3. did some bat<insert bad word here> crazy stuff with python. it was fun.
- golang - wanted to learn a new lang, so i started with go this year, replaced my python stuff with go (because its fast and beautiful). im planning to use golang for SiliconCemetery's backend since i dont really like nodejs. 
- .Net framework - thanks for my windows C++ experience, i know a bit about .net.
- Javascript - i dont like javascript.
- Nim (not much tbh) - still learning. boring syntax. but fine.

### Things I do

- kernel programming - linux to be more specific.
- systems programming
- reverse engineering
- malware analysis
- CTFs :^) - i dont have a team and not a pro. 
- IoT (ESP and arduino) - WIFI security stuff. not very useful.
- and sometimes I draw things

### Things I use
    
- (neo)vim is my main text editor. you can find my config on dotfiles repo
- vs / vscode on windows
- Manjaro on my laptop, arch linux, ubuntu on VMs and Windows host on my PC 
- radare2 on linux
- x64dbg on windows
- IDA on both

### Some cool projects I did/still doing :^)

**Finished** - 
- **[zkz](https://github.com/rxOred/zkz.git)** `x86 linux debugger written in C++. more features incoming!!!`
- **[elfparse](https://github.com/rxOred/elfparse.git)** `linux x64 Elf binary file parser written in C.`
- **[spidyBOT](https://github.com/rxOred/spidyBOT.git)** `A web spider and information gathering tool written in python.`
- **[BURUWA](https://github.com/rxOred/BURUWA.git)** `A very minimal Linux shell. pretty much useless :^).`
- **[InjElf](https://github.com/rxOred/InjElf.git)** `A Elf infector written in C, uses text padding infection`
    
**Not yet finished** - 
- **[rurik](https://github.com/rxOred/rurik.git)** `TUI text editor with some other IDE like features.` i wanted to make something like spacevim. i'll probably rewrite the whole codebase in golang:3
- **[InjPE](https://github.com/rxOred/InjPE.git)** `A PE code cave infector written in C++.`
- **[WormLikeSnake]**
- **[Lib]** `A program that extracts processor specific information using cpuid instrution on intel processors` 
- **[zkinject]** `A C++ library to work with elf binaries, linux /proc file system and ptrace system call`

### Currently working on

- working on zkz, zkinject and Lib.
- trying to build sri lanka's first known hackerspace - SiliconCemetery
- building a web application for SiliconCemetery with few other people (status - UI design is done)
- working on an efficient terminal user interface for zkz debugger and implementing cde injection and elf reconstruction

### Support or Contact

So you wanna support me? criticize my code and tell me how bad it is. That helps me to be a better programmer and thats all I want :^)
