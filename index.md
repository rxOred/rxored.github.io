## Welcome to this ugly looking static web site Github generated for Me!

As my web designing and development skills are far too superior for humans to understand (lies liessss), i decided to use this thing as my portfolio type of thing :)

I'm looking forward to start a blog where i can put all my useless research articles and projects :^)

### Hold up, whoami?

Well Im just a 17y/o student from Sri Lanka(sadly). I taught myself many things related to computer science. And I like to do things that require deep understanding of how computers work :). Specifically, kernel/system programming, reverse engineering and malware analysis.

### Stuff I know

- C/C++/C hashtag :^)
- x86 assembly
- python
- golang
- .Net framework
- Javascript
- Nim (not much tbh)

### Stuff I do

- kernel programming
- systems programming
- reverse engineering
- malware analysis
- CTFs :^)
- IoT (ESP and arduino)
- and sometimes I draw things

### Stuff I use

- vim / lunarvim / emacs
- vs / vscode
- GNU/Linux
- radare2
- x64dbg
