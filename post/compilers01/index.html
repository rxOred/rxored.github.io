<p>This article is all about compilers.
For many people, a compiler is mystery. for them, it is like a magical black box that takes the source file as an input and generates a binary file which can be executed.
However, the truth to be told, compilers are not wizards. In this article we will start from the introduction to front-end of a compiler in a reverse engineering perspective.
Next articles will contain detailed explainations of the optimizer, and the back-end.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-compiler-and-how-does-it-affect-reverse-engineering-process">What is a compiler and how does it affect reverse engineering process.<a href="#what-is-a-compiler-and-how-does-it-affect-reverse-engineering-process" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>A compiler is a very complex piece of software, and what it essentially does is, taking one representation of a program as an input and generating a representation of the same program.
This input representation is usually the text file containing the source code that compiles with the specifications of a specific high level language. And the
Output is usually a low-level language representaition of the same program.</p>
<p>Sounds not that complex right? Well, this is just a high level owerview. During this process of tranlation between different representaitions, input source will have to face many
algorithms, techniques employed by the compiler to optimize the low-level representaition it generates. These algorithms may add more levels of complexity on top of the original code.
And may even contain code that the developer is not intended of writing. These things makes it harder for someone to read the compiler generated code.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-architecture">Compiler architecture.<a href="#compiler-architecture" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Compiler architecture mainly consist of 3 things
- Front end
- Optimizer
- Back end</p>
<p>I this first article, lets dive into Front end.</p>
<h2 id="the-front-end">The front end.<a href="#the-front-end" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>tbh, front is the least important out of the above 3 in a reverse engineering perspective. anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>So what does this thing do? well, the front end is the place where process of compilation begins.</p>
<h2 id="lexical-analysis">Lexical analysis<a href="#lexical-analysis" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Lexical analyzer is a part of the compiler front end and responsible for tokenizing
the given source file. What this means is that, when given a stream of characters, lexical analyzer can turn that stream of characters into a set of distinct lexemes. These lexemes can
be seperated by some delimeter. A token can have many lexemes, which essentially means that a token is a category of lexemes, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>for example, following statement
<code> if ( i == 0 )</code>
can be broken down into</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>lexemes</th>
<th>token</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>if</td>
<td>condition</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(</td>
<td>bracket_open</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>i</td>
<td>indetifier</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>==</td>
<td>equal_sign</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>)</td>
<td>bracket_end</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Tokenizing is very similar to how we break down complex sentences in natural languages. just like how a sentence is devided into different parts.
But unlike humans, to achieve this task, lexical analyzers use pattern matching algorithms and regular expressions.</p>
<p>Its also worth mentioning that lexical analysis or tokenizing can be done using unix utilities like FLEX and ANTLR.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-analysis">Syntax analysis<a href="#syntax-analysis" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Syntax analysis is the second phrase of compiler&rsquo;s front end. Unlike lexical analysis, where pattern matching algorithms and regular expressions are used to identify tokens, Systax analysis use a
concept known as Context Free Grammar (CFGs). Context Free Grammar is kinda similar to regular grammar but its mainly used to describe syntax of programming languages. basically its a superset of regular grammar.</p>
<p>When lexical analyzer outputs the stream of tokens, these tokens are then fed into the syntax analyzer. Then the syntax analyzer analyzes and parses the stream of tokens against different rules and
detect syntax errors in the code.</p>
<p>for example, <code>if ( i == 0 </code> is passed down, it is syntax analyzers job to report it as an error. However some syntax analyzers are capable of continue the parsing process even if there are syntax errors. To achieve
this, syntax analyzers use error recovery strategies.</p>
<p>After parsing all the syntax, syntax analyzer should generate a parse tree. A parse tree is a representation of the production rules.</p>
<p>for example, applying left-derivation production rule on <code>x + b - c</code>, resulting parse tree is</p>
<pre><code>E -&gt; E - E
E -&gt; E + E - E
E -&gt; id + E - E
E -&gt; id + id - id

        E
    ---------
    |   |   |
    E   -   E
____|____
|   |   |
E   +   E
</code></pre>
<p>Syntax analysis can be done using YACC(Yet Another Compiler Compiler), CUP, Bison and ANTLR.</p>
<h3 id="abstract-synstax-trees-asts">Abstract Synstax Trees (ASTs)<a href="#abstract-synstax-trees-asts" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Just like a parse tree, an abstract syntax tree or AST is a graph representation of the source code. How an AST is differ from a parse tree is, an AST is a simplified version of the parse tree. And in ASTs operators
are internal nodes. ASTs are also considered to be the out of syntax analysis phase of a compiler.</p>
<p>Remember CFGs?, in modern programming languages there are lots of things that CFGs cant express. for example type definitions. Almost every modern language allows new types. However CFGs cannot represent new types and
their usage. ASTs can solve these problems.</p>
<p>Another major usage of ASTs is that, a full traversal of the AST data structure represent the correctness of the program. ASTs are heavily used in semantic analysis too.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">THE END<a href="#the-end" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>So yeah thats it for compiler front end. I suggest readers to go through &ldquo;Concepts of programming languages&rdquo; for more detailed explainations.
I&rsquo;ll do the optimization article soon. until then&hellip;</p>
